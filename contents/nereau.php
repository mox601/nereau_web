<b><i>Nereau: a social approach to query expansion</i></b><br><br>
Classical query expansion techniques can be roughly divided into two groups: the statistical approach, which consists of the selection of top-ranked terms from relevant sources based on co-occurrence values, and the semantic approach, where candidate terms are chosen based on their meaning. In this paper we present a novel approach, in which the classical cooccurrence matrix is enhanced with metadata retrieved from social bookmarking services in order to overcome its lack of semantic attributes. The implemented system, named Nereau, combines methods from the areas of Information Retrieval and Social Network Analysis: given the original query, our system performs multiple expansions and presents results divided into categories. We use a new approach to web personalization based on user collaboration sharing of information about web documents. Our evaluation results are encouraging and suggest that personalization based on social bookmarking and tagging is a useful addition to web toolset and that the subject is worth further research, in particular with regard to increasing popularity of social and collaborative services in the WWW today.
